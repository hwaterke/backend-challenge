# Backend challenge

I created this repo to explore different languages and frameworks.
The objective is to create an API with many different languages/frameworks in order to better identify good practices amongst them. (e.g. separation of concerns, file structure, abstractions, dependency management, etc.)

Here is the plan:

- Elixir / Phoenix
- Typescript (Node) / Hapi
- Java / Spring Boot
- Kotlin / Ktor
- Ruby / Rails
- Python / Django or Flask
- PHP / Laravel
